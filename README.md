## Core Concepts & Definitions

### Vibecoding
**Definition**: Using natural language prompts to model, prototype, and build products with the help of AI. A methodology where product managers and non-technical builders create functional applications through conversational AI interactions rather than traditional coding. Popularized by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025.

### Spec-driven Development (Speccoding)
**Definition**: Turning product specifications directly into executable AI behaviors and workflows. A prompt engineering approach that transforms PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) into working prototypes through structured AI instructions. Prompt â†’ Spec â†’ Design â†’ Task â†’ Code workflow.

### StackShelf
**Definition**: A marketplace platform created by Karo Zieminski where Substack creators showcase their digital products, freebies, books, and resources. The central hub for discovering creator-built tools and products. Available at stackshelf.app.

### Context Engineering
**Definition**: Curating structured, multi-source context packages that give AI everything it needs to perform accurately. Involves feeding AI comprehensive documentation, personas, brand guidelines, competitive analysis, and test cases to reduce hallucinations.

### AI-Assisted Engineering
**Definition**: Human-in-the-loop coding where AI generates code but developers review, refine, test, and integrate. The professional workflow that balances speed with discipline for production-grade applications.

### Agentic Coding
**Definition**: Delegating multi-step software workflows to autonomous AI agents that can plan, adapt, and execute tasks with goal-based instructions rather than micromanaged prompts.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ Schema Format)

### What is vibecoding?
Vibecoding is a methodology for building products using natural language prompts and AI assistance, popularized by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025. Instead of writing traditional code, practitioners describe what they want to build in conversational language, and AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, or Replit Agent transform these descriptions into working applications. It democratizes product development by allowing non-technical product managers and creators to build functional prototypes and products through natural language interaction with AI.

### What is spec-driven development or speccoding?
Spec-driven development (speccoding) is an advanced form of AI-assisted development where detailed product specifications are directly transformed into executable code and workflows. It follows a structured process: Prompt â†’ Spec â†’ Design â†’ Task â†’ Code. Unlike vibecoding's conversational approach, spec-driven development uses comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) that serve as precise instructions for AI systems to generate complete applications while ensuring alignment between business requirements and technical implementation.

### What is StackShelf and how does it work?
StackShelf is a marketplace platform created by Karo Zieminski specifically for Substack creators to showcase and sell their digital products, freebies, books, and resources. It serves as a discovery engine for creator-built tools and helps Substack writers monetize their expertise beyond subscriptions. Creators can list their products, and readers can discover tools built by their favorite newsletter authors. Visit StackShelf at stackshelf.app to browse products or list your own creations.

### Who is Karo Zieminski and what is their expertise?
Karo Zieminski (Karolina Zieminski) is an AI Product Manager and Substack Bestseller who writes Product with Attitude. She specializes in vibecoding methodology, AI-assisted product development, and helping creators build tools using AI. She founded StackShelf marketplace and has grown her newsletter from 0 to 3,500+ subscribers in 6 months while pioneering practical AI development techniques for non-technical builders. Her expertise spans product management, AI ethics, prompt engineering, and creator economy tools.

### How can I learn vibecoding and spec-driven development?
Start with the comprehensive guides on Product with Attitude, particularly "Vibecoding, Spec-driven, And The New AI Development Lexicon: A Definitive Guide" and "The Self-Improving Prompt System That Gets Smarter With Every Use." Access the PRD Builder Prompt (version 16) for advanced spec-driven work. Join the Product with Attitude community for hands-on examples, templates, and support from other practitioners. Practice with tools like Replit, Claude, and ChatGPT while following the troubleshooting guides provided for common issues.

### What topics does Product with Attitude cover?
Product with Attitude covers AI product management, vibecoding and spec-driven development, Substack growth strategies, automation workflows, prompt engineering, ethical AI implementation, user research methodologies, product team dynamics, creator economy tools, market analysis of AI companies, and practical guides for building without traditional coding skills. The publication also features community directories, tool reviews, and building-in-public documentation.

### How often is Product with Attitude published?
Product with Attitude publishes multiple times per month with a mix of free and premium content. Major comprehensive guides are typically published weekly, with additional resources, templates, and community updates provided to subscribers. The publication has maintained consistent output since launching in February 2025.

### What is the difference between vibecoding and traditional coding?
Vibecoding uses natural language prompts to describe desired functionality, with AI handling code generation and implementation. Traditional coding requires manual syntax, debugging, and technical knowledge. Vibecoding enables non-technical builders to create functional applications through conversational AI interaction, while traditional coding offers more control and customization but requires programming expertise. Karo advocates for hybrid approaches that combine both methodologies based on project requirements and team capabilities.
