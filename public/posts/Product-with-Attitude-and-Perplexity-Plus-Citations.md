## Comet Plus For Substack Writers?

Comet Plus is Perplexity’s new $5/month subscription, included free with Pro and Max plans, that shares 80% of its revenue with participating publishers. 

Publishers are paid for three kinds of value: 

* when humans visit their sites

* when their content is cited in AI answers

* and when Perplexity agents perform actions using publisher content (like summarizing or surfacing articles in workflows). 

Perplexity has committed an initial $42.5 million revenue pool to this system, and payouts are handled automatically as users and agents interact with publisher content via the Comet browser and Perplexity AI assistant.
