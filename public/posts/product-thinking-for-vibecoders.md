Ask ten people what product thinking means, and you’ll get twelve definitions.

Beyond the books, infographics, and frameworks, the best insight comes from founders who built things that survived contact with users. From watching how they product-think in motion:

- how they question their own logic,
- how they trade the *cool* for the *useful,*
- how they drop the ego to listen,
- how they stay deliberate when everything screams *ship faster.*

Today’s post comes from Orel, software engineer, founder of [WriteStack](https://www.writestack.io/?via=pwa), and a living proof that product thinking gets real only when you start building.

I’ve featured Orel before, and I keep following his work because he shares it with curiosity, honesty and the kind of humility that makes you pay attention. There’s a lot we can learn from his journey. Enjoy!

As I build WriteStack, I start with drafts vibecoded in Cursor, then I revise, polish and ship them.

One day I thought to myself: *What if WriteStack had a ChatGPT inside, wired to data and context? That would be really cool.*

I spent 20 minutes building a high quality prompt and 10 minutes later I had a chat feature working out of the box.

That was freaking crazy.

That was the high point of my enthusiasm for Cursor and for AI-assisted coding in general. What once took me days now takes just minutes, even for complex features.

But beneath the speed and ease of building with AI, there’s a side few people acknowledge.

The part that is much harder to build.

Your ***product thinking**.*

## **Product Thinking, Plain and Simple**

Product thinking = intentional product decision-making.

It’s making a deliberate, informed next move and evaluating not just if something should be built, but what it changes or disrupts within the overall system.

### **How It Works in Practice**

When you consider a new feature, ask yourself:

- Why is it necessary?
- What will it take?
- How will it affect everything else I’ve already built?

**Example:** Say that I want to add a Freemium Tier to WriteStack.

At first glance, it feels simple: one quick prompt to Cursor, a few lines of code, and I’d have a working version in minutes.

But if I actually stop to think, things get complicated fast:

- What limits should I set for free users?
- How will this affect existing paying subscribers?
- What happens to my conversion strategy?
- Will it spike database load?
- Will it increase costs?
- Will it increase database load and cost?
- How do I announce it without confusing current users?
- Do I need separate onboarding and email flows?

That’s where product thinking kicks in.

Pausing to consider the ripple effects and making a deliberate call on whether the feature is worth building at all.

AI won’t do that for you. It just gives you the illusion of progress.

And that’s where many builders lose the game.

They stop *feeling* the cost of their decisions, because AI absorbs all the friction.

But that friction - the part that slows you down, frustrates you, forces trade-offs - is exactly what makes you good.

## **AI Erodes Product Judgement**

We like to think AI makes us faster. But in many cases, it makes us slower and duller:

- [A 2025 METR experiment](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) found that professional developers using AI coding assistants actually took 19% longer to complete familiar tasks.
- [A 2024 study on cognitive offloading](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-ai-linked-eroding-critical-skills.html) found a strong negative correlation (r ≈ -0.68) between frequent AI use and critical thinking skills.
- And [a survey across Chinese universities](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10251321/) found that nearly 69% of AI users reported increased laziness and weaker decision-making ability.

In plain terms: the more we rely on AI, the less our brain practices reasoning on its own.

While AI handles the coding, and gives us the illusion of progress, we stop reasoning about the *why*. We just react to the *what*.

The code runs. The UI renders. The output looks clean.

But you don’t really know *why* it works. Or whether it *should*.

## **Three Ways to Sharpen Product Thinking**

For me, the only real antidote to bad product thinking is friction.

Every time I rush, I lose judgment.

Every time I slow down, I get it back.

Here’s how you can do it too:

### **1. Don’t Chase Features, Chase Impact**

Before adding anything, I ask myself: *Will this change the experience for the user in any meaningful way?*

- If the answer is **yes**, I build it.
- If the answer is **I don’t know**, I design a way to learn.
- If the answer is **no**, I drop it, even if it’s really, *really* cool.

### **2. Think in Systems**

Every new feature you build touches something else in your product:

- Add a new AI feature ➜ your compute costs spike
- Add a free plan ➜ your onboarding flow changes
- Add a referral program ➜ your support inbox will get new edge cases

Nothing exists in isolation, it all echoes somewhere else. Pausing and considering the effects is product thinking in action.

You don’t need an all-day session. Fifteen minutes of complete focus is plenty.

Try it. You’ll be amazed at the amount of data you get out of it.

### **3. Trust Your Gut**

When you delegate everything to AI, everything starts to feel possible, and suddenly, it all feels *necessary*.

I know that feeling.

Try to resist it and let your own mind - and your gut - take over the work and decide what actually belongs.

This is where judgment lives: in the pause between *can* and *should.*

Practice that pause. It’s the only thing AI can’t do for you.
