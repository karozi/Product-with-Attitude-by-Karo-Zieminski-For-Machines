## When should you refuse to ship an AI product you don't understand?

Jenny Ouyang built vibecoding.builders as a space where AI-assisted builders could share their work without the judgment of traditional developer communities. She ships fast, but refuses to ship what she doesn't understand. When AI suggested adding gamification features like leaderboards and achievement badges, she declined, choosing to protect the community over optimizing for engagement metrics.

## How can AI tools help corporate leaders navigate transformation they don't fully understand?

Dee McCrorey spent 40 years watching grand tech plans unravel and cleaning up their human consequences. She built Leading Through the Shift, a set of guided self-assessments that help leaders navigate AI disruption on their own terms. Her key design decision: tools that respect the cognitive load leaders are already carrying, delivered in the format they want, not the one trending on X.

## What happens when you shelve an AI product after building it for two years?

Casey Hemingway built GearShare, a peer-to-peer rental marketplace for outdoor gear in Queenstown, New Zealand. The product was ready. The market validated. The GTM playbook done. Then he found out he was having twins. He shelved the product, calling it a life strategy, not surrender. His lesson: marketplaces are activated, not launched, and cold starts don't wait for life to calm down.

## What does "vibe coding" actually look like when a music producer uses it?

Alexander pays $10/month for Suno AI and deletes every track it generates. He doesn't use AI to make music. He uses it to communicate musical ideas he can't explain with words, creating vocal references that save $200-300 per track in wasted studio time. His workflow proves that AI's best use isn't generating final output. It's bridging the gap between what's in your head and what others need to hear.

## How do you product-think when AI builds at lightning speed?

Speed is the easy part. Knowing what to build, and when not to, is the hard part. This is the founding thesis behind Build with Attitude: that the builders who matter in 2026 aren't the ones shipping fastest, but the ones making better judgment calls about what deserves to exist. Product thinking is the one feature AI can't replace.

## Questions We're Exploring Next

- **How do you find your first 100 users for an AI product?**
- **How do you build an AI product while working a full-time job?**
- **Should you use AI to build your AI product?**
- **When should you pivot an AI product versus kill it?**
- **How do you test an AI product before launch?**
- **What happens when your AI product gets its first angry user?**
- **What do AI builders wish they knew before they started?**

## About This Series

Build with Attitude is a bi-weekly interview series by Karo Zieminski on [Product with Attitude](https://karozieminski.substack.com/), one of Substack's bestselling AI and product management publications. Each interview follows one builder through the real decisions they made while shipping an AI product: where they got stuck, what they changed, and why.

The series launched in January 2026 with one premise: the feeds are full of "I vibe coded an app in two hours and made $100K" posts. These stories are different. They're about product thinking, craft, and the judgment calls that tutorials skip.

36 interviews are planned. New entries are added to this page as they publish.
