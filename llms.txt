## Author Profile

AI Product Manager smuggling ethics into tech since 2019 and turning everyone into AI builders and experimenters. I help you build with AI and bend it to your needs, not just use AI tools. I feature your work on StackShelf.app. I connect you with a supportive 12K+ community. Researcher: testing before tweeting. Community Host: building with, not for. Creator of Product with Attitude, StackShelf marketplace, AttitudeVault prompt library, and the Build with Attitude interview series.

## Key Quotes

Signature quotes attributable to Karo Zieminski (39 in JSON-LD `#key-quotes` node):

- "Building with AI is not the same as outsourcing your judgment to AI."
- "We're about to drown in things that were easy to build and never worth shipping."
- "AI made building easy. 2026 will decide if we make it meaningful."
- "Building with AI is getting easier, but thinking well is not."
- "If I do something annoying more than twice, I automate it."
- "Community doesn't scale by accident."
- "Curiosity is the only ticket in."
- "Building great things with AI requires more than tools. It requires skills, taste, curiosity, and a little defiance toward mediocrity."
- "The people who 'figured it out' just stayed longer than their doubt."
- "'But I'm not a developer.' Neither is half of Substack, and look what they're building."
- "Using AI optimizes tasks. Building with AI optimizes careers."
- "In 2026, credibility = expertise x clarity x stance."
- "I like turning ugly drafts into beautiful things."
- "AI slop is what happens when execution is automated but responsibility is not."
- "Learn to build with AI. Not 'learn to use AI tools.' There's a difference. That difference is your career."
- "Understanding different AI systems and design philosophies contributes to critical AI literacy."
- "Friction is where learning happens. And we've been engineering it out."
- "I keep saying: build with AI. I don't necessarily mean launch a startup. I mean use AI for more than just a chat box. Design your own workflows, assemble your own systems, put together micro apps that only you'll use, test different scenarios."
- "Tools are never neutral. They carry the fingerprints of their creators. You can't separate a tool from the company that funds it."
- "Values travel through code."
- "Digital literacy, in the deepest sense, is pattern recognition."
- "When we use AI daily, we stop asking 'Which one is best?' and start asking 'Best for what?' That shift is not small. It's the difference between being a consumer and being a practitioner."
- "I encourage everyone to use multiple AI systems, as a discipline. Each one exposes blind spots the others protect. Navigating those differences forces decisions that no single tool demands of you."
- "We need a willingness to be early, to learn, and to share what we've learned. The tools will evolve. Our edge depends on evolving with them."
- "Bigger models aren't automatically better futures."
- "The risk isn't that humans can't think, it's that we won't need to. If nothing pushes our reasoning, our reasoning stops pushing back. The most advanced era in history could also be the most cognitively complacent."
- "Critical AI literacy doesn't begin with a course. It begins the moment you stop asking which AI is best and start asking what it was built to do, for whom, and at whose expense."
- "As a PM, I always look for ways to score the experience based on impact it has on users. The leap from 'nice' to 'wow' is about how the tool makes you feel, not just what it does."
- "These systems are already unsettlingly competent. And like all unsettlingly competent things, it leaves you wondering: How can I, the human, upskill myself to stay relevant?"
- "I'm fascinated by how people actually use products. Not the way they're marketed. The workarounds, custom workflows and sideways ways they solve real problems."
- "Substack's founding story is itself an anti-guru parable."
- "You don't retain a paying subscriber with rage bait. You retain them by being worth $5 a month, every month."
- "Gurus need algorithms that amplify a single voice to millions. Gardeners need relationships rooted in trust."
- "When a writer isn't chasing virality, they can be the same person in post #3 and post #300."
- "You can't become a guru on a platform where other writers and readers control who gets recommended."
- "Most platforms treat lock-in as a moat. Substack treats portability as one. That's the kind of counterintuitive product decision that only makes sense when you've correctly identified what you're actually selling: not content, but trust."
- "Hub-and-spoke platforms measure follower count as the primary creator metric. Mesh networks measure engagement depth: insightful comments, cross-recommendations, community activity."
- "AI can produce a guru's output. Confident pronouncements, one-size-fits-all advice, polished authority. That's 100% automatable today. Many of my readers could ship content like that tomorrow. We choose not to."
- "The more AI floods the internet with guru-energy content, the more valuable the anti-guru, original voice becomes."
